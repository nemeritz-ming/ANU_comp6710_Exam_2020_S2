This repo contains an IntelliJ project for the 2020 S2 exam.

You have **3 hours and 15 mins** to complete the exam.

This exam is open book.   This means that you may use books, notes, and any
other such *pre-existing* information as you complete the exam.   You **must
not** communicate with any person other than the examiners at any time during
the exam.  Chat, text, email and all other such forms of communications **must**
be turned off prior to the exam and must remain off for the **duration of the
exam**.

Important notes:
 * There are six (6) questions, each worth different marks.
 * The total marks for the exam are 90 (15 + 5 + 25 + 20 + 5 + 20)
 * The exam will be **entirely auto-graded**, so it is important that your code
  passes the tests, and that you commit and push your work.
 * There are two practice questions, **P1** and **P2**.   You do  not need to
  complete them.  They are worth **zero** marks.   They are there
 only to help you prepare your environment for the exam.

*This is the end of the exam.   What follows are instructions for the practice
questions.*

## Practice Questions

These are instructions for what to do **before** the exam.

You should do the two practice questions below, and ensure that they work in
your environment.   You should check:
 
1. that the provided test for P1 works correctly in IntelliJ,
2. that you can successfully pass the test for P1,
3. that you can fill in the answers for P2,
4. that you can can commit and push your work,
5. that the CI says that you have passed P1 and that P2 has been checked

Note that the CI will not tell you whether the multiple choice question P2 is
correct or incorrect, it will only tell you whether it was correctly formatted.

Remember, the questions below are **practice** questions which you should attempt
during the practice *before* the exam.  The practice questions are here *only*
to help you check that your environment is working correctly.  **The practice
questions are not worth any marks.**
  
The first is an example of a programming  question.
 
### P1 [0 Marks]  Hello World

Using the incomplete template for [P1HelloWorld.java](src/comp1110/exam/P1HelloWorld.java),
complete the unimplemented main method.
 
Use the tests provided to test your solution, and then commit and push your
changes to GitLab.


### P2 [0 Marks] Sample Multiple Choice

For each of the following multiple-choice questions, identify the choice that
provides the best answer.  Record your choices in the file [p-2.csv](p-2.csv),
one line per question.  
 
For example, to answer "a" to question P2.1, "d" to question P2.2, "a" to
question P2.4, and leave question P2.3 blank, you would record the following
in `p-2.csv`:
 ````
1,a
2,d
3,
4,a
````

These *practice* questions are worth **zero** marks.   But in the actual exam,
there will be four multiple choice questions, and each question that is
correctly answered gains you 5 marks, each question answered incorrectly loses
you 1 mark, a question left unanswered neither loses nor gains marks. The final
mark for the question in the exam is calculated by bounding the
sum of marks between 0 and 20. For example, if you answered all questions
correctly in the exam you would gain 20. If you answer 1 correctly and 2
incorrectly you would gain 3/20.

Once you have answered the questions you should **commit** your `p-2.csv` file,
and **push** it.   You should **check the exam CI** to see whether it passed
the formatting check.   If it did not, you should read the error messages
and fix up any formatting problems with your answer.  *Note that the CI won't
tell you whether your answers are correct, only whether they are correctly
formatted.*
